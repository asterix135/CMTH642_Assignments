## Stratified sampling function

stratified <- function(df, group, size) {
    # USE: * Specify your data frame and grouping variable (as column
    # number) as the first two arguments.
    # * Decide on your sample size. For a sample proportional to the
    # population, enter "size" as a decimal. For an equal number
    # of samples from each group, enter "size" as a whole number.
    #
    # Example 1: Sample 10% of each group from a data frame named "z",
    # where the grouping variable is the fourth variable, use:
    #
    # > stratified(z, 4, .1)
    #
    # Example 2: Sample 5 observations from each group from a data frame
    # named "z"; grouping variable is the third variable:
    #
    # > stratified(z, 3, 5)
    #
    require(sampling)
    temp = df[order(df[group]),]
    colsToReturn <- ncol(df)
    
    #Don't want to attempt to sample more than possible
    dfCounts <- table(df[group])
    if (size > min(dfCounts)) {
        size <- min(dfCounts)
    }
    
    
    
    if (size < 1) {
        size = ceiling(table(temp[group]) * size)
    } else if (size >= 1) {
        size = rep(size, times=length(table(temp[group])))
    }
    strat = strata(temp, stratanames = names(temp[group]),
                   size = size, method = "srswor")
    (dsample = getdata(temp, strat))
    
    dsample <- dsample[order(dsample[1]),]
    dsample <- data.frame(dsample[,1:colsToReturn], row.names=NULL)
    return(dsample)
